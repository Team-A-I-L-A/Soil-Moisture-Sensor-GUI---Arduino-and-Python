## Folders description 📁

* **[ARDUINO]**: This folder contains the code in C++ language for the logic and communication for the Arduino microcontroller.

* **[PYTHON]**: This folder contains the code in Python language and the images necessary for the logic and communication of the Soil Moisture Sensor GUI.


## Main Files description 📘

* **[transmisionSensorHumedad.ino]**: This file contains the C++ language code of the Arduino microcontroller. It contains the logic and the communication parameters to connect to the sensor GUI. It is necessary to clarify that it is thought for a microcontroller connected by USB to a computer.

* **[sensorHumedadSuelo.py]**: This file contains the code in Python language that conforms the sensor GUI as well as the communication parameters with the Arduino microcontroller connected to the USB of the computer where it is running.
